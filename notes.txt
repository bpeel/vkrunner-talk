* Introduction
  * What is VkRunner?
    * Tool to test shaders on your Vulkan driver
    * Inspired by shader_runner
    * Minimal overhead to execute a script
    * Just write the scripts and some simple commands to execute them
    * Standalone tool, runs the script and reports status

  * History
    * Work on ARB_gl_spirv
      * Adding SPIR-V support to the i965 driver in Mesa
      * Uses the same compiler as Vulkan
      * Ended up with more more extensive testing of SPIR-V than
        exists for Vulkan because of automatic test conversion from
        GLSL tests.
      * We wanted to quickly be able to verify whether test failures
        are a general problem with the compiler or a problem specific
        to SPIR-V on GL.
      * Run shader_runner tests on Vulkan with the minimum of conversion.
        * However there are major differences.
        * shader_runner can use the GL API to query properties of the
          shader such as variable names.
        * This information isnâ€™t available in Vulkan so the script has
          to use explicit offsets for setting UBO/SSBO data.
      * Some improvements over shader_runner
        * shader_runner grown organically over time. Lives in a single
          large C file.
        * VkRunner code written from scratch with the benefit of
          hindsight.
        * Tries to partially automatically generate commands.
          * Such as systematic method for setting pipeline properties.
          * Try to support all formats for vertex data and framebuffer.

* Examples
  * Simple rectangle example to test a particular function.
  * Using more vertex inputs
  * Testing an extension
  * Compute shader
  * SPIR-V
    * Example needing manual edit of SPIR-V
  * Binary

* Current status
  * Features
    * All stages
    * Compute shaders
    * UBOs/SSBOs
    * Vertex data, simple drawing
    * Probing
    * Library
  * Integration in Piglit and CTS
    * Existing library of tests in Piglit

* Future
  * Missing features
    * Major feature missing image/texture support.
      * There is a pull request for this.
  * More tests
    * Please add Piglit tests for any Vulkan features you add.
  * UI
    * Just for fun.
  * Video
    * Example bling for fun.
    * shadertoy
  * Amber
  * Clean up script format?

* Demo?
